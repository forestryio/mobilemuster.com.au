MobileMuster provides a free mobile phone recycling program that accepts all brands and types of mobile phones, plus their batteries, chargers and accessories. It is the mobile phone industry's way of ensuring old mobile phone products don't end up in landfill - but instead are recycled in a safe, secure and ethical way.\
\
MobileMuster is managed by the [Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA)](http://www.amta.org.au/) on behalf of our members.

* Handset manufacturers (Microsoft, Samsung, Motorola, HTC, Huawei, ZTE, Alcatel, Oppo, HMD Global, Google)
* Network carriers (Telstra, Optus, Vodafone, Virgin Mobile)

### Product Stewardship

MobileMuster is the only government accredited mobile phone recycling program in Australia. The program gained accreditation in 2014 under the [Product Stewardship Act 2011](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2011A00076) which provides a framework to effectively address the environmental, health and safety impacts of a product or material across its full lifecycle, from manufacture to disposal.\
\
The mobile phone industry is constantly working to reduce the environmental and human health impacts of their products, across their entire lifecycles. This includes:

* Improving how efficiently resources are used in the production of mobile phones
* Ensuring that mobiles collected are recycled to the highest environmental standards
* Minimising waste in the manufacture, production, use and disposal of mobiles and accessories
* Reducing risk to human health through better management of product manufacturing and disposal (e.g. ensuring safe work environments)

### Latest Achievements

The industry has invested over $42 million into the program which has recycled over 11 million handsets and batteries since it was established in 1998.\
\
In 2017 the program collected and recycled 79 tonnes of mobile phone components including over one million handsets and batteries. Since 1998 over 1,323 tonnes of mobile phone components have been collected and recycled.\
\
In the last year, the program diverted 99% of the components collected from landfill. The recovered materials were returned to the supply chain to be used in the production of new products.\
\
MobileMuster provides an extensive collection network with over 3,500 public drop off points across the country along with a free post back option. The program also partners with workplaces and schools who promote mobile phone recycling to their staff and community, along with running internal collection drives.
