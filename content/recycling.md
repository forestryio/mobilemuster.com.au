### Broken Phones

If your mobile phone is broken and you can't remove your data you can still safely and securely recycle it. MobileMuster ensures that any data left of your mobile phone is destroyed during the recycling process so you can feel confident no one can ever access your information in the future.

### Data management tips

Before you recycle, sell or give away your mobile phone, you should remove your personal information. If your mobile phone is still working we encourage you to take the following steps.

1. Back up your data. Back up or transfer files and information you want to keep to a computer or online storage. Check to see if you can access your manufacturer’s software to complete the process.
2. Log Out. You may be using a number of online accounts and social media. You will need to log out of these platforms through the administration and security settings.
3. Perform a Reset. A reset will erase all the data from your device’s internal storage. Depending on what type of mobile phone you have, the instructions will vary. We recommend that you check the user guide or instructions on the manufactures website.
4. Remove the SIM and memory card. Transfer any files that you have stored on the memory and SIM card. Once the data is removed they can be reused or recycled depending on your intentions.
