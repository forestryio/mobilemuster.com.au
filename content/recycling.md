### Broken Phones

If your mobile phone is broken and you can't remove your data you can still safely and securely recycle it. MobileMuster ensures that any data left of your mobile phone is destroyed during the recycling process so you can feel confident no one can ever access your information in the future.

### Data management tips

Before you recycle, sell or give away your mobile phone, you should remove your personal information. If your mobile phone is still working we encourage you to take the following steps.

1. **Back up your data**. Back up or transfer files and information you want to keep to a computer or online storage. Check to see if you can access your manufacturer’s software to complete the process.
2. **Log Out**. You may be using a number of online accounts and social media. You will need to log out of these platforms through the administration and security settings.
3. **Perform a Reset**. A reset will erase all the data from your device’s internal storage. Depending on what type of mobile phone you have, the instructions will vary. We recommend that you check the user guide or instructions on the manufactures website.
4. **Remove the SIM and memory card**. Transfer any files that you have stored on the memory and SIM card. Once the data is removed they can be reused or recycled depending on your intentions.

**Need help?**

# The Recycling Process

MobileMuster partners with TES, a global leader in electronic waste recycling, to maximize recovery rates and ensure all the mobile phone components are processed in an environmentally responsible manner. Through our recycling over 99% of the materials in a mobile phone are recovered. This process reduces the impact of mobile phones on the environment, minimises the resources that are thrown away and promotes the development of a circular economy.

**Step 1: Transporting
**

When you drop off your old mobile phones for recycling they are collected and transported to TES’s recycling facilities in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane.

**
Step 2: Sorting
**

At the recycling facility the mobile phones are disassembled into their components. Nothing collected by the program is resold. Once disassembled the parts are sorted into the following: batteries, printed circuit boards, handsets, accessories, plastics, metals and packaging.

**Step 3: Processing
**

The components are processed separately to maximise resource recovery. Any data left on the device is destroyed through this process.

**Step 4: Materials Extracted
**

The materials recovered in the recycling process can be used in the manufacture of new products. For example the recycled plastic from the mobile phone cases is used to make shipping pallets and the lithium extracted from mobile phone batteries can be reused to make new batteries.

**
The environmental benefits of recycling**

The recycling process reduces the need to extract virgin material from the earth which saves energy, conserves scarce natural resources and protects our environment.
