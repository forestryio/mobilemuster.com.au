What Happens: The Recycling Process
MobileMuster partners with TES, a global leader in electronic waste recycling, to maximize recovery rates and ensure all the mobile phone components are processed in an environmentally responsible manner. Through our recycling over 99% of the materials in a mobile phone are recovered. This process reduces the impact of mobile phones on the environment, minimises the resources that are thrown away and promotes the development of a circular economy.

Step 1: Transporting

When you drop off your old mobile phones for recycling they are collected and transported to TES’s recycling facilities in Melbourne, Sydney or Brisbane.

Step 2: Sorting

At the recycling facility the mobile phones are disassembled into their components. Nothing collected by the program is resold. Once disassembled the parts are sorted into the following: batteries, printed circuit boards, handsets, accessories, plastics, metals and packaging.

Step 3: Processing

The components are processed separately to maximise resource recovery. Any data left on the device is destroyed through this process.

Step 5: Materials Extracted
The materials recovered in the recycling process can be used in the manufacture of new products. For example the recycled plastic from the mobile phone cases is used to make shipping pallets and the lithium extracted from mobile phone batteries can be reused to make new batteries.<br><br>
The recycling process reduces the need to extract virgin material from the earth which saves energy, conserves scarce natural resources and protects our environment.

More information
TES is widely recognised as a global leader in electronic waste recycling. Their e-waste recycling facilities utilise state of the art equipment and processing techniques aimed at delivering the lowest possible environmental impact. They invest in research, development and technology that maximises recovery of commodities and raw materials for reuse. TES maintains international best practice certifications; R2 (Responsible Recycling), ISO 9001, 14001, 27001, 28000, OHSAS 18001, and TAPA.

Why recycling matters
By recycling your mobile, you'll be avoiding future greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy, protecting the environment and conserving natural resources. You're also preventing potentially hazardous materials from entering the environment.

  <li class=''>99% of the materials used in mobiles and accessories can be recovered through recycling</li>
  <li class=''>These materials can be used to make everything from stainless steel to plastic pallets</li>
  <li class=''>Mobiles should never be thrown out. They're not biodegradable and contain some materials that can potentially harm the environment if not handled correctly at the end of a phone's useful life</li>
  <li class=''>For every tonne of mobile phone components recycled 9 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions are avoided</li>

How to manage data when recycling your mobile
Before you recycle, sell or give away your mobile phone, you should remove your personal information.

What type of hoarder are you?
Australians continue to hold on to their old mobiles, many of which are no longer working. Learn more about why we find it hard to let go.

Educators
MobileMuster has created a schools program to provide teachers and students with practical and engaging learning resources. Our learning resources are aligned to the Australian curriculum and specific modules have been developed for Early Learning, Primary and Secondary students.

It is hoped that the knowledge gained through the MobileMuster learning modules will increase student’s knowledge, engagement, critical thinking and commitment to living in a sustainable society. Schools can participate in their own MobileMuster event which will demonstrate their commitment to individual and community action for sustainability.

How to run a successful MobileMuster at your school

 If your class, environmental group or SRC are running e muster follow our steps below to make it a success.
 <ul class='ph0 ph0-ns pt0'>
<li>Introduce the students to the program by visiting the website and watching the MobileMuster promise video.</li>
<li>Organise a collection unit from MobileMuster or make your own by reusing a cardboard box or bucket.</li>
<li>Work out where is the best location for the MobileMuster collection unit and make your own. Make sure the area is visible and secure and the unit can be stored for the duration of the muster.</li>
<li>Plan how you will record the number mobile phones are collected during the muster. Set on what you think could be collected.</li>
<li>Undertake a survey on how many old mobile phones they have in their home. Design and distribute a survey to your school community or class.</li>
<li>Create a poster to advertise the MobileMuster event, this can be done individually, in groups or as a class.</li>
<li>Explore other ideas for promotion. For example writing articles for the school newsletter and social media, sending an article to the local newspaper, announcing the event at the school assembly, sending an email to class parents so that it can be distributed around the school.</li>
<li>At the end of the muster it’s important to think about how effective or successful your school’s muster was. Write a brief report for the school newsletter communicating the results of the MobileMuster.</li>
<ul class='ph0 ph0-ns pt0'>
    <li>Were the goals reached?</li>
    <li>Was the promotion successful?</li>
    <li>Did the event create awareness about recycling?</li>
    <li>How could you improve the muster for next year?</li>
</ul>
<li>Try to conclude the muster experience with some sort of celebration, thanking the students for their efforts. Share any records broken, or any rewards reached. Thank the students for making a difference. Encourage them to put these recycling practices into their everyday life.
- Share your student work and stories with MobileMuster.</li>
