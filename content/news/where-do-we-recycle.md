intro: >-
  *There have been a number of news stories recently about the impact of China’s
  foreign waste ban in Australia. From 1 July China will not be accepting waste
  products including paper, textiles and certain metals to be imported. The
  Australian Mobile Telecommunication Association (AMTA), which manages the
  MobileMuster program, would like to inform the general public and its
  collection partners that the ban will have no impact on MobileMuster’s
  recycling process.

\*Everything collected by MobileMuster is recycled and nothing is sold for reuse. The mobile phones and accessories we receive are dismantled in Australia initially before being recycled for resource recovery in Australia and Singapore. Through the programs recycling effort over 99% of the materials in a mobile phone are recovered.
