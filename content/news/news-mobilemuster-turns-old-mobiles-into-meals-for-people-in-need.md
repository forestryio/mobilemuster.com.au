Over summer MobileMuster teamed up with OzHarvest to encourage Australians to clean out the junk drawer and recycle their old mobiles through the Mobile for a Meal initiative.

We achieved our target of recycling 70,000 mobiles which meant we were able to deliver 70,000 meals to vulnerable Australians through OzHarvest. Thanks to all of our collection partners and everyone who participated.  

**What happens with the phones?**

When we receive your mobiles and accessories, everything is dismantled and the components processed to maximize recovery rates and ensure everything is recycled in an environmentally responsible manner. 

Through our recycling over 99% of the materials in a mobile phone are recovered. This process reduces the impact of mobile phones on the environment, minimises the resources that are thrown away and promotes the development of a circular economy.
