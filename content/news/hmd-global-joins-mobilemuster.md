As the mobile telecommunications industry’s official recycling program, the service provides a free take back program for old mobiles and accessories. Run in partnership with mobile handset manufacturers and network operators Telstra, Optus, Vodafone and Virgin Mobile the service provides a free national recycling program to mobile phone users.

“The mobile telecommunications industry is delighted to welcome Nokia phones, one of the industry’s most iconic and recognisable brands, to our world-class recycling program,” said Chief Executive Officer of AMTA, Chris Althaus.

“Nokia phones was a founding member of MobileMuster in 1998, so it’s great to welcome HMD Global into the program. Our members work together to ensure old mobiles are kept out of landfill and recycled in a responsible, secure and environmentally sound way, placing reusable commodities back into the supply chain.”

Since MobileMuster started in late 1998 it has diverted more than 1,320 tonnes of mobiles and accessories from landfill for recycling, including more than an estimated 11.9 million handsets and batteries.

 “As we bring the new range of Nokia Android smartphones, including the latest Nokia 8, into the Australian market we are proud to join the industry-funded program and offer our customers a sustainable recycling service,” said Mark Trundle, Country Manager for HMD Global Australia.

“Being part of this government accredited initiative gives us great confidence that our smartphones, batteries and accessories, once they have finished their useful life, will be recycled to the highest environmental standards.”

With over 96 per cent of the materials used in a mobile being recyclable, they can be reused to make new products, avoiding future greenhouse gas emissions, saving energy, protecting our environment and conserving scarce natural resources.

MobileMuster accepts and recycles all brands and types of mobile phones, batteries, chargers and accessories.  Everything is recycled, nothing is resold and all data is destroyed. There are over 3,500 drop-off points Australia wide for consumers to recycle their old mobiles, batteries and accessories.
