  We all have one; a little rough around the edges, not as cool as they used to
  be, or maybe you’ve upgraded to the latest model, they are simply old, broken,
  and unwanted. We’re talking about mobiles, millions in fact.

Around Australia there are almost 5 million old mobile phones which are no longer working, along with their chargers and accessories, begging to be lifted out of the junk drawer and be put to better use, which is exactly what Australian’s can do this summer.



Not for profit’s MobileMuster and OzHarvest have teamed up to give Australians a great reason to recycle their old phone, because this summer for every mobile recycled they will deliver a meal to someone in need. The campaign, Mobile for a Meal, returns for a second year after a hugely successful recycling drive last summer, where 60,000 meals were delivered simply by people recycling their old mobile, this year they are aiming to recycle 70,000 and help deliver 70,000 meals to those in need.



“It is one of those beautiful win-win situations where no one wants these old phones - you can’t use them, or sell them - they are quite literally useless, but if we recycle them over 99% of the material can go back into making new products. In return, we will deliver a meal to someone in need,” said Spyro Kalos, Recycling Manager, MobileMuster.



“It’s important to remember that mobile phones are not biodegradable, and they contain substances and materials that can potentially harm the environment if not recycled responsibly,” And it’s very easy to recycle your old mobile phone when it comes to the end of its life as there are over 3,5000 public collection points around Australia,” said Kalos.



OzHarvest’s Founder, Ronni Kahn said the demand for food is on the rise. “There are now more than 3.6 million people experiencing food insecurity each year. At OzHarvest we are doing our best to deliver to good, nutritious food to people in need, but many agencies say they could take double to keep up with demand. With as little as $1 we can deliver 2 meals, so make sure you give your old mobile a new purpose.”
