intro: >-
  Look in a room, drawer or storage box in any home and you’ll find something
  that has become a common burden on Australians; it’s clutter, junk, items that
  aren’t being used, are broken and not needed anymore - and this is weighing us
  down, costing us time and money, when it could instead be put to use and do
  some good.

This Christmas, not-for-profit waste organisations MobileMuster and OzHarvest have teamed up to encourage Australians to clean out that junk drawer, and any old mobiles that you find; recycle them and a meal will go to someone in need through the Mobile for a Meal initiative.



Around Australia there are almost 5 million old mobile phones which are no longer working, along with the mountain of chargers and accessories that go along with them.



Eco Organiser Tanya Lewis has seen first-hand what this kind of clutter can mean to those that live in it; “We become lost in clutter, our lives are busier than ever but then disorganisation can creep in,”



“And then there is the financial burden where we see, once families declutter and organise their space, they could be saving between $100-$250 a month, as they are buying less, using what they have and responsibly disposing of what they no longer need,”



Responsible recycling is at the heart of Mobile for a Meal said Spyro Kalos, Manager, MobileMuster, “It’s important to remember that mobile phones are not biodegradable, and they contain substances and materials that can potentially harm the environment,”



“It’s very easy to recycle your old mobile phone when it comes to the end of its life as there are over 3,500 public collection points around Australia,” said Kalos



Lewis believes that rather than trying to declutter in one go, stop and rethink what you have in your home and start spending just 10-15 minutes a day decluttering and organising each part of the house, “At Christmas, when it’s a time to have friends and family with you and in your home, you want to feel good about it! So it’s the perfect time to spend a short 15 minutes tackling the old gadgets drawer, getting them out and doing some good with those old phones,” said Lewis.



Lewis also notes, in nearly every part of the house, you can find clutter which can be donated to charities or people who need it, and ensure that you are disposing of your unwanted goods responsibly and helping others at the same time.
