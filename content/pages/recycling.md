Data management tips
Before you recycle, sell or give away your mobile phone, you should remove your personal information. If your mobile phone is still working we encourage you to take the following steps.
<ol>
  <li><span class='b'>Back up your data</span>. Back up or transfer files and information you want to keep to a computer or online storage. Check to see if you can access your manufacturer’s software to complete the process.
</li>
  <li><span class='b'>Log Out</span>. You may be using a number of online accounts and social media. You will need to log out of these platforms through the administration and security settings.
</li>
  <li><span class='b'>Perform a Reset</span>. A reset will erase all the data from your device’s internal storage. Depending on what type of mobile phone you have, the instructions will vary. We recommend that you check the user guide or instructions on the manufactures website.
</li>
  <li><span class='b'>Remove the SIM and memory card</span>. Transfer any files that you have stored on the memory and SIM card. Once the data is removed they can be reused or recycled depending on your intentions.
</li>
</ol>
