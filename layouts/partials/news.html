                <p>The agricultural and veterinary chemical waste disposal program has teamed up with MobileMuster, the mobile industry product stewardship program, for the first collection of its kind, giving remote farmers and growers a chance to recycle mobiles and accessories. MobileMuster recycling manager, Spyro Kalos said the collaboration will make it easy for rural residents to responsibly dispose of both their mobile phones and chemicals in one convenient collection.</p>

                <p>"This is a great initiative that tackles two waste streams and gives residents an opportunity to declutter their home or work space in a safe, secure and environmentally sound way," he said.</p>

                <p>The aim of the MobileMuster program is to keep old mobiles and accessories out of landfill and ensure they are responsibly recycled. MobileMuster accepts and recycles all brands and types of mobile phones and accessories.  Everything is recycled, nothing is resold and all data is destroyed in the process. ChemClear is a waste management program that encourages farmers and other agvet chemical users to clean up their farms and chemical stores, and register unused chemicals for collection and safe disposal to ensure sound environmental practices.</p>

                <p>Waste holders have until 27 April to register their unwanted farm chemicals visit <a href="http://chemclear.org.au/" target="_blank">chemclear.org.au</a> for details.</p>

          There have been a number of news stories recently about the impact of China’s foreign waste ban in Australia. From 1 July China will not be accepting waste products including paper, textiles and certain metals to be imported. The Australian Mobile Telecommunication Association (AMTA), which manages the MobileMuster program, would like to inform the general public and its collection partners that the ban will have no impact on MobileMuster’s recycling  process.

                This Christmas, not-for-profit waste organisations MobileMuster and OzHarvest have teamed up to encourage Australians to clean out that junk drawer, and any old mobiles that you find; recycle them and a meal will go to someone in need through the Mobile for a Meal initiative.
                </p>
                <p>
                Around Australia there are almost 5 million old mobile phones which are no longer working, along with the mountain of chargers and accessories that go along with them.
                </p>
                <p>
                Eco Organiser Tanya Lewis has seen first-hand what this kind of clutter can mean to those that live in it; “We become lost in clutter, our lives are busier than ever but then disorganisation can creep in,”
                </p>
                <p>
                “And then there is the financial burden where we see, once families declutter and organise their space, they could be saving between $100-$250 a month, as they are buying less, using what they have and responsibly disposing of what they no longer need,”
                </p>
                <p>
                Responsible recycling is at the heart of Mobile for a Meal said Spyro Kalos, Manager, MobileMuster, “It’s important to remember that mobile phones are not biodegradable, and they contain substances and materials that can potentially harm the environment,”
                </p>
                <p>
                “It’s very easy to recycle your old mobile phone when it comes to the end of its life as there are over 3,500 public collection points around Australia,” said Kalos
                </p>
                <p>
                Lewis believes that rather than trying to declutter in one go, stop and rethink what you have in your home and start spending just 10-15 minutes a day decluttering and organising each part of the house, “At Christmas, when it’s a time to have friends and family with you and in your home, you want to feel good about it! So it’s the perfect time to spend a short 15 minutes tackling the old gadgets drawer, getting them out and doing some good with those old phones,” said Lewis.
                </p>
                <p>
                Lewis also notes, in nearly every part of the house, you can find clutter which can be donated to charities or people who need it, and ensure that you are disposing of your unwanted goods responsibly and helping others at the same time.


                Getting involved in the Mobile for a Meal campaign is simple:
                1.       Go to www.mobilemuster.org.au and find your nearest place to recycle

                4.       Just make sure you recycle before the end of February 2018 to be a part of Mobile for a Meal

                <p>Around Australia there are almost 5 million old mobile phones which are no longer working, along with their chargers and accessories, begging to be lifted out of the junk drawer and be put to better use, which is exactly what Australian’s can do this summer.</p>
                <p>Not for profit’s MobileMuster and OzHarvest have teamed up to give Australians a great reason to recycle their old phone, because this summer for every mobile recycled they will deliver a meal to someone in need.  The campaign, Mobile for a Meal, returns for a second year after a hugely successful recycling drive last summer, where 60,000 meals were delivered simply by people recycling their old mobile, this year they are aiming to recycle 70,000 and help deliver 70,000 meals to those in need.</p>
                <p>“It is one of those beautiful win-win situations where no one wants these old phones - you can’t use them, or sell them - they are quite literally useless, but if we recycle them over 99% of the material can go back into making new products. In return, we will deliver a meal to someone in need,” said Spyro Kalos, Recycling Manager, MobileMuster.</p>
                <p>“It’s important to remember that mobile phones are not biodegradable, and they contain substances and materials that can potentially harm the environment if not recycled responsibly,” And it’s very easy to recycle your old mobile phone when it comes to the end of its life as there are over 3,5000 public collection points around Australia,” said Kalos.</p>
                <p>OzHarvest’s Founder, Ronni Kahn said the demand for food is on the rise. “There are now more than 3.6 million people experiencing food insecurity each year. At OzHarvest we are doing our best to deliver to good, nutritious food to people in need, but many agencies say they could take double to keep up with demand. With as little as $1 we can deliver 2 meals, so make sure you give your old mobile a new purpose.”</p>

               <p>Currently there are an estimated 288,000 Australians who live with no hearing and sight and this number is predicted to rise to over one million by 2050 (1). This September MobileMuster has partnered with <span><a href="http://www.ableaustralia.org.au/">Able Australia</a></span> and are calling on workplaces to donate old smartphones to support the deafblind community.</p>
               <p>Smartphones collected during the initiative will be donated to Able Australia to improve the digital literacy of the deafblind community.  The phones will be used to educate people on how to use speech recognition and Braille readers via mobile technology.</p>
               <p>Deafblindness is very much Australia's forgotten disability. Able Australia tells us that nine out of ten deafblind people will experience depression and anxiety and the simple act of donating an unwanted phone is an easy way to show your support to Australia’s deafblind community. Unwanted smartphones play a vital link that can transform a socially isolated person with deafblindness into an active member of their local community. Something most of us take for granted.</p>
               <p>Mobile technology can also help people with deafblindness participate in the workforce. A report by Deloitte Access Economics commissioned by the Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA) found that mobile technology allows people with deafblindness to communicate, engage and interact, thereby improving their daily lives and opportunities to participate in the workforce (2).</p>
               <p>Australia has over 31 million mobile phone subscribers who, on average, replace their handsets every 18 to 24 months. We know there are approximately 23 million unused mobiles sitting in homes and workplaces around Australia, some of these may be smartphones that could help the deafblind community. Now is the perfect time to donate your unwanted mobile phone to a great cause.</p>
               <p>Each smartphone will be checked to confirm it is working and any data left of the phone will be wiped to ensure privacy. MobileMuster will also ensure that any mobiles and accessories that can’t be reused will be recycled by MobileMuster in a safe, secure and ethical way, with all data being destroyed in the recycling process.</p>

               <p>This initiative will run for the month of September. MobileMuster will provide you with resources to support your participation. We have a Able Australia mailing label which you can simply download and attach to your package containing old smartphones and chargers.</p>
